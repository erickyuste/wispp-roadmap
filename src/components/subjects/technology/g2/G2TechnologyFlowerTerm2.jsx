          design criteria, including the needs of the community they are trying

          • Children will continue to work on their short stories. They are
          demonstrating a sequence of steps, purposely designed as a short
          story, which they will later on publish in a safe environment. This
          learning experience has been designed to involve the use of animation
          software, however, if devices are not available, children may draw
          each scene on paper, photograph them and create a sequence (similar to
          a stop motion). This would take a longer time to complete, so teachers
          must plan accordingly.

        <p className="font-semibold text-xs md:text-[16px] sm:text-sm text-white ">
          • If using software, provide the required support according to
          children’s needs. Depending on how familiar they are with using
          devices, children may need more or less time to work through their
          story boards. Working in pairs may also be helpful.
