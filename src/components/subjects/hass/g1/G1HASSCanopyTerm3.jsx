          • When briefly discussing climate change, teachers should remain
          sensitive of children’s concerns and anxiety that may arise from the
          topic. Be clear that climate change is caused by actions of people as
          a whole so to avoid children feeling guilty. Gear the climate change
          discussion towards solutions and actions people can take to help.

          • Contact families prior to these learning experiences and ask for
          their support in collecting statements from friends and family members
          who have grown up or lived in different countries (see learning
          experiences). Some children may not know anyone suitable. These
          children should be encouraged to interview people who may have had
          different experiences, such as growing up on the coast or inland,
          travelling frequently, etc. Children may also work in pairs or small
          groups to interview the same person.

          • If interviewing people is not suitable to the context, teachers are
          encouraged to change the learning experience and provide children with
          statements instead.
